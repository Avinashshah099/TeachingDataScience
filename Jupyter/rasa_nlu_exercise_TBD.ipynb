    "* Windows Build tools: Make sure the Microsoft $VC++$ Compiler Visual Studio 2015 is installed, so python can compile any dependencies or https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ Download the installer and select VC++ Build tools in the list.\n",

    "(My Note: on main page of Anaconda is https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ you see Python 3.7, which is problematic, gives HTTP error while creating env. I had to delete 3.7 and get 3.6. Btw, this site does not mention which Anaconda installer has which Python version. WHY? thats the most crucial info. Anyway, I have given them here.)\n",

    "* So, **conda create -n rasa python=3.6** \n",
