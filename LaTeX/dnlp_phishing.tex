	\item  Attackers use disguised email addresses as a weapon to target large companies. 
	\item With the huge number of phishing emails received every day, companies are not able to detect all of them. 
	\item Here, we will build machine learning models to detect phishing attempts, using Python.

import numpy as np
from sklearn import *
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Prepare Training Data}

Identify the inputs (all of the attributes, except for the last one) and the outputs (the last attribute):

\begin{lstlisting}
inputs = training_data[:,:-1]
outputs = training_data[:, -1]

training_inputs = inputs[:2000]
training_outputs = outputs[:2000] 
testing_inputs = inputs[2000:]
testing_outputs = outputs[2000:]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Modeling}

\begin{lstlisting}
classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(training_inputs, training_outputs)
predictions = classifier.predict(testing_inputs)
accuracy = 100.0 * accuracy_score(testing_outputs, predictions)

print ("The accuracy of your Logistic Regression on testing data is: " + str(accuracy))

>> 84.85
\end{lstlisting}

The accuracy of our model is approximately 85\%. This is a good accuracy, since our model detected 85 phishing URLs out of 100.
