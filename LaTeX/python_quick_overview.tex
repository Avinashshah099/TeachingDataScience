\item Python is open source, free and cross-platform.
\item Python provides high-level built in data structures.
\item Python is useful for rapid application development.
\item Python can be used as a scripting or glue language.
\item Python emphasizes readability.
\item Python supports modules and packages.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{The Zen of Python}
{\em \large There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way	to do it.}



Pythonic way of doing things.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{The Python shell, I}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Python can be run from ``shell'', IDE, Notebook
 \item Shell/Command Line:
\begin{lstlisting}
> python

Python 3.5.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 12 2017, 16:16:49) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
\end{lstlisting}
\item Start writing commands/expressions at the $>>>$ prompt.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Python shell, II}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressions are evaluated and the result is printed:
	\begin{lstlisting}
	>>> 2+2
	4
	\end{lstlisting}

\item Line continuation with \\ 
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> "hello" + \
... " world!"
'hello world!'
\end{lstlisting}
\item The prompt changes to `\texttt{...}' on continuation lines and for loops, function definitions, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Overall Syntax}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comments are indicated with ``\#''
\item Multiple statements on the same line are separated with ``;''
\item No semicolon at the end of lines.
%\item a long line continue on next with ``\'' (it is not always needed)
\item Scope is obtained through indentation. 
\item Always indent next line if ``:'' is at the end of current line.
\item One script is can be run or imported by other modules.
%\item  assignment uses the equal sign ``=''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Assignment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assignment creates references, not values:
\lstinline{tmp = "hello"; tmp = 10}
the first string will be deallocated
%\item Contrary to C, assignment do not have value:
%\lstinline{y = (x = x + 1)}
% is invalid
\item As in C programming: \lstinline{x += 1} is valid
\item Pre/post increment/decrements: \lstinline{x++; ++x; x--;--x} are invalid
\item Multiple assignment (references to a unique object):\lstinline{x=y=z=1}
\item Multiple assignments: \lstinline{(x,y,z)=(3.5,5.5,`string')}
\item  Example of swapping variables value: \lstinline{(x,y)=(y,x)}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Special variables}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Python relies on many special variables that can be accessed by your code.
%\item One is the \lstinline{name} variables.
%\item When a module is run, it contains the string \lstinline{main}.
%\item When the module is imported, it contains the modules name.
%\item You can add code that runs only when a module is called directly:\lstinline{if __name__ == __ main__: test()}
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Default Dict}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is like a regular dictionary, except that when you try	to look up a key it doesn't	contain, it first adds a value for it using a zero-argument function you provided when you created it.	
  \begin{lstlisting}
word_counts = defaultdict(int) # assigns 0 for the newly added key
for word in document:
	word_counts[word]	+= 1
  \end{lstlisting}
\item Can also be useful with list	or dict	or even your	own functions
  \begin{lstlisting}
ddlist = defaultdict(list) # assigns empty list for the newly added key
ddlist[2].append(1) 
  \end{lstlisting}
\item When 2 was not present, added it with value as empty list, to which 1 was added
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Counter}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A Counter turns a sequence of values into a defaultdict(int)-like object mapping keys to counts.	
  \begin{lstlisting}
from collections import Counter
c = Counter([0, 1, 2, 0]) # c is (basically) { 0 :	2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1}
  \end{lstlisting}
\item This gives us a very simple way to	solve our word\_counts problem
  \begin{lstlisting}
word_counts	= Counter(document)
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{tuples}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item They are like lists but immutable. 
  \item When you want to make sure the content won't change.
  \item What's the advantage?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Zip and Argument Unpacking}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item zip transforms multiple lists into a single list of tuples
  \begin{lstlisting}
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
zip(list1, list2) # is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
  \end{lstlisting}
\item 	If the	lists are different lengths, zip stops as soon as the first list ends.
\item You can also unzip
  \begin{lstlisting}
pairs = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
letters, numbers = zip(*pairs)
  \end{lstlisting}
\item The asterisk performs argument unpacking
  \end{itemize}

  \item close \lstinline{output.close()}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Unsupported Types}
  \begin{itemize}
%  \item no Boolean type, use integers. But, `True', `False'
  \item no char or single byte, use strings of length one or integers
  \item no pointer
  \item int vs. short vs. long, only one integer type (C long)
  \item float vs. double, only one floating point type (C double)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Comparisons vs. Equality}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline{L1 = [1, ('a', 3)]}
  \item \lstinline{L2 = [1, ('a', 3)]}
  \item \lstinline{L1 == L2} is 1
    \item The \lstinline{==} operator tests value equivalence
    \item \lstinline{L1 is L2} is 0

  \item The \lstinline{is} operator tests object identity

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Modules, namespaces and packages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A file is a module, e.g. `myio.py', with a function 'load'
  \item To use that function from another file:

  \item Code in 'myio.py' will be in the 'myio' namespace.
  \item Selective import:
      \begin{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Not so basic}
List Comprehension: Need not use all the values
  \begin{lstlisting}

  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Not so basic: Generators}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item List can grow big, very big, which can be a huge source of inefficiency, especially if you need only few values
   \item Generator iterate over and produce as and when needed
   \item Create using function and keyword {\em yield}
  \begin{lstlisting}
def lazy_range(n):
"""a lazy version of range"""
i = 0
while i < n:
    yield i
    i += 1
  \end{lstlisting}
\item Following loop will consume yielded values, one at a time until none are left:
  \begin{lstlisting}
for i in lazy_range(10):
	do_something_with(i)
  \end{lstlisting}
\item Python has ready function like that called {\em range()}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Not so basic: Randomness}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Many times you need to use random numbers
  \begin{lstlisting}
import	random
four_uniform_randoms = [random.random() for _ in range(4)]
# [0.8444218515250481,	 # random.random() produces numbers
# 0.7579544029403025,	# uniformly between 0 and 1
# 0.420571580830845, #	it's the random function we'll use
# 0.25891675029296335]	 # most often
  \end{lstlisting}
\item 	Actually produces pseudo-random	(that is, deterministic) numbers based on an internal state that you can set with random.seed	
  \begin{lstlisting}
random.seed(10) # set the seed to 10
print random.random() # 0.57140259469 
random.seed(10) # reset the seed to 10
