%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Your Own Website}
 If you already have an existing website and want to add a Rasa assistant to it, you have a couple of options:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Rasa Webchat, which uses websockets.
\item Chatroom, which uses regular HTTP requests.
\item rasa-bot, a Web Component which uses regular HTTP requests.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Websocket Channel}
 \begin{itemize}
\item The SocketIO channel uses websockets and is real-time. 
\item You need to supply a credentials.yml with the following content:
\begin{lstlisting}
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true/false
\end{lstlisting}
\item The first two configuration values define the event names used by Rasa Core when sending or receiving messages over socket.io.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{REST Channel}
 \begin{itemize}
\item The RestInput and CallbackInput channels can be used for custom integrations. 
\item They provide a URL where you can post messages and either receive response messages directly, or asynchronously via a webhook.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{REST Channel}
 \begin{itemize}
\item The rest channel will provide you with a REST endpoint to post messages to and in response to that request will send back the bots messages. In credentials.yml
\begin{lstlisting}
rest:
  # you don't need to provide anything here - this channel doesn't
  # require any credentials
\end{lstlisting}
\item After connecting the rest input channel, you can post messages to POST /webhooks/rest/webhook with the following format:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "sender": "Rasa",
  "message": "Hi there!"
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{CallbackInput Channel}
 \begin{itemize}
\item The callback channel behaves very much like the rest input, but instead of directly returning the bot messages to the HTTP request that sends the message, it will call a URL you can specify to send bot messages.
\begin{lstlisting}
callback:
  # URL to which Core will send the bot responses
  url: "http://localhost:5034/bot"
\end{lstlisting}
\item After connecting the callback input channel, you can post messages to POST /webhooks/callback/webhook with the following format:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "sender": "Rasa",
  "message": "Hi there!"
}
\end{lstlisting}
\item The response will simply be success.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

{\Large Slack}

\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Slack?}
\begin{itemize}
\item A chat room for all your company communications.
\item Essentially a replacement for your emails
\item Organizes into Workspaces (Groups)
\item Within Workspaces you can have Apps and channels (Projects) with different people.
\item Slack integrates with a host of other apps so you can manage your entire workflow through one platform
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pre-requsites}
Following are Rasa specific actions that need to be done before going to Slack Deployment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Train both NLU and Dialog models together : \lstinline|rasa train|
\item Have endpoints.yml, this is for actions, a separate window, activate env: 
\begin{lstlisting}
action_endpoint:
	  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
\end{lstlisting}
\item Run rasa action server by
\begin{lstlisting}
python -W ignore -m rasa run actions
\end{lstlisting}
``-W ignore'' removes the numpy FutureWarnings
\item Because action\_endpoint is for the actions, not for anything else, and it can run on different/default port 5055.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack Account Creation}
\begin{itemize}
\item First, create Slack Account with a Workspace.
\item Create a new Workspace,https://slack.com/create give email, verify it
\item Name of your company ``DataHacksConf2019'', thats the workspace name.
\item Project name ``rasachatbot'', thats the channel name.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack App}
\begin{itemize}
\item Then, create a Slack App. WIthin Workshpace, you can have Apps apart from Channels.
\item Visit https://api.slack.com/
\item Create a Slack app in ``RasaChatBotDemo'', 
\item Select ``DataHacksConf2019'' as Workspace
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{rasa27}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack App}
\begin{itemize}
\item In ``Add features and functionalities'' panel, select ``Bots'' tab.
\item Also, available on the left hand menu, you will see ``Features'', Select ``Bots Users''
\item ``Add a Bot user'' with defaults
\item Select ``OAuth \& Permissions'', Note down OAuth token (starts with xoxb)
\item Have credentials.yml: 
\begin{lstlisting}
slack:
	slack_token: "xoxb-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack App}
State should look like:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{rasa28}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack App}
\begin{itemize}
\item Click ``Basic Information' on left hand menu, you should see both ``Bots'' and ``Permissions'' tabs selected.
\item Scroll to Display Information and add more about our bot like a picture, a description and a background colour.
\item Picture needs to be specific quality as shown in the picture below.
\item Save all changes (button below)
\item ``Install App Workspace''. Authorize (``Allow'') it and we have our app ready and integrated into the workplace.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{rasa29}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Event Subscriptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subscribe to some workplace events like:
\item ``app\_mention'' so that our bot responds when someone mentions it by name
\item ``message\_im'' which allows the user to send direct messages to the bot.
\item Save your all work.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack Rasa Message flow}
\begin{itemize}
\item $Slack \rightarrow ngrok \rightarrow Rasa$ is the main message flow path. 
\item So, between rasa server and ngrok the port has to be same, say 5004. 
\item Then between ngrok and slack the url token has to be same. This how chaining/binding is done.
\item Another observation: Need to start rasa server on , say 5004, first, then ngrok http on 5004, then get the ngrok url token, put it in Slack Verify then only it verifies fine else it errors. Order seems important
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rasachatbot2}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rasa Server}
In another window, with activate rasa environment on a different port 5004

\begin{lstlisting}
python -W ignore -m rasa run --connector slack --port 5004 --cors *
\end{lstlisting}
You will get a message like this:  Starting Rasa server on http://localhost:5004

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Ngrok}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ngrok is a multiplatform tunnelling. 
\item It assigns ip, so basically the app running on our local would be available via the internet publicly.
\item Gives your machine a domain name so that Facebook, Slack, etc. know where to send messages to reach your local machine.
\item Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download 	
\item Extrtact the zip to the exe. Its a command line application.
\item Now ,Start it with which port we want to expose to the public internet : \lstinline| ./ngrok http 5004|
\item Note down different ngrok token, aa98d86f, use that later in Slack
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{rasa30}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Slack Verify}
In Slack App Event subscription, Verify (rasa server, ngrok, actions, all must be running)
\begin{lstlisting}
https://aa98d86f.ngrok.io/webhooks/slack/webhook
\end{lstlisting}
You should get the green tick here. Now you are ready to chat!!
