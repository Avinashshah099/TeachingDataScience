  \frametitle{Main tasks of Information Extraction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Named Entity Recognition (Chunking, Parsing)
    \item Relation Extraction 
    \item Relations like subject are syntactic, relations like person, location, agent or message are semantic
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Stress is associated with migraines 
    \item Stress can lead to loss of magnesium 
    \item Calcium channel blockers prevent some migraines 
    \item Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker
