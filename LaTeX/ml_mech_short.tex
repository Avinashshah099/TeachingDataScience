\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{New wave: IoT}
IoT and Machine Learning
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic idea of machine learning is to build a mathematical model based on training data(learning stage) ,  predict results for new data(prediction stage) and tweak the model based on new conditions
\item  IoT creates a lot of contextual data 
\item Use the scale of IoT data to gain new insights
\end{itemize}
