 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Hands-On: Chatbot in 3 files}

\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir firstbot
cd firstbot
activate rasa_env
rasa init  --no-prompt
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Creates project structure and dummy files. 
\item Good to run and execute
\item You can run as is or add your data to nlu.md, stories.md and domain.yml; retrain and run.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{NLU}

\begin{itemize}
\item Your chatbot needs to understand what your users are saying,
\item Give alternative examples to learn from that identify your users intent.
\item For example, you teach your bot that ``Hi'' and ``Hello'' represent an intent greeting. 
\item Do this in data/nlu.md
\end{itemize}


\begin{lstlisting}
## intent:greeting
- hi
- hello
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Dialog}

\begin{itemize}
\item Also need to teach your bot how to respond to these intents in varying sequences that in Rasa are called stories
\item Store that in data/stories.md
\item Stars represent intents identified by Natural Language Understanding based on your data/nlu.md 
\item Dashes represent responses (called utterances) provided by your chatbot and defined as templates in domain.yml
\end{itemize}


\begin{lstlisting}
## first story
* greeting
  - utter_greet_back
* farewell
  - utter_farewell
\end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Domain}
