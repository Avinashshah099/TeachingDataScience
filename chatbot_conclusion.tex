3 take home thoughts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conversational AI is a big part of the future
\item ML techniques help advance state-of-the-art NLU and conversational AI
\item  Open source is strategically important for enterprises 
implementing AI
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Steps for building Chatbot }
\begin{itemize}
\item Decide domain (better if smaller)
\item Design conversations (list all possible questions, answers)
\item List intents (verbs), entities (nouns), actions (call-backs), response (query results)
\item Train AI/ML engine 
\item Write backend Db code
\item Create and update knowledge-base (offline, with new info)
\item Test scenarios and improve
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule Based (AIML)
\begin{itemize}
\item Decision tree, with small samples ok
\item Pre-defined responses, so predictable
\end{itemize}
\item ML Based (Rasa)
\begin{itemize}
\item Large Samples a must
\item More natural responses, but initially unpredictable
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Start with AIML, once data is received go with ML based

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item RASA Is an Open Sourced Python implementation for NLP Engine / Intent Extraction / Dialogue $\rightarrow$ in which all of the above run on your machine / On premise $\rightarrow$ NO CLOUD!
\item RASA can be integrated with different front ends like Slack, Facebook Messenger, or your own web app.
\end{itemize}
