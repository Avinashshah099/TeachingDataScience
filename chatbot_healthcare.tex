\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Benefits of Chatbots?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cost savings: According to Juniper Research, chatbots could save organizations up to \$8 billion annually by 2022, a figure that was predicted to be at \$20 million just a year ago. Using bots can expect average time savings of just over four minutes per inquiry, equating to average cost savings in the range of \$0.50-\$0.70 per interaction.
\item Can improve at-home care.  ``Virtual nurses'' (like Florence) could help patients take their medications and connect with their primary care physicians.
\item Chatbots are more secure than a search engine. Are built with security protocols and requirements, making them a great HIPAA-compliant option for both patients and healthcare providers.
\end{itemize}
