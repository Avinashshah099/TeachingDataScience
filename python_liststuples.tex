\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}
Replace items by assigning them
  a new value:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L = ['U', 'Z', 'H']
>>> L[2] = 'G'
>>> print(L)
['U', 'Z', 'G']
\end{lstlisting}
Try negative indices.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}

Replace an entire slice:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L[1:3] = ['a', 'b']
>>> print(L)
['U', 'a', 'b']
\end{lstlisting}
The range on the left is replaced by range on the right. If there is mismatch in the lengths? Try \ldots. 

Try negative ranges as well. If the range evaluates to null (L[-1:-2]) then right hand array is inserted at the -2 position?
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}
New slice does not need to have the same length:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L[2:] = range(4)
>>> print(L)
['U', 'a', 0, 1, 2, 3]
\end{lstlisting}
From 2 onwards there are only 1 (last) element, in its place put all of the right hand side, ie, array from 0 to 4.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}
Add an element
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L.append(4)
>>> L
['a', 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
\end{lstlisting}
Return type of append() is None. It mutates the list itself. It does NOT return the modified list (like Strings).

So don't do:

\begin{lstlisting}
L = L.append(4)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}
Remove individual items from a list either by specifying the item:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L.remove('U')
>>> L
['a', 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}
or the position:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L.pop(1)
0
>>> L
['a', 1, 2, 3, 4]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}

Note: \texttt{remove()} method only removes \textit{the first occurrence}:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L = ['a', 'b', 'a']
>>> L.remove('a')
>>> L
['b', 'a']
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List mutation}

``del'' operator can be used two ways:

Remoes definition of 2nd position, thus the list shrinks.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L = ['a', 'b', 'a']
>>> del L[1]
>>> L
['a', 'a']
\end{lstlisting}

Remove the definition of whole list:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> del L
>>> L
"Not defined error"
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List Sorting}

Dont use old L.sort() method but newer sorted method.

Here sorted returns the copy of the sorted list keeping original intact.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L = [5,3,4,7]
>>> M = sorted(L)
>>> L
[5,3,4,7]
>>> M
[3,4,5,7]
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List Sorting}

Applies to strings also. The sorted() function can be customized through optional arguments. The sorted() optional argument reverse=True, e.g. sorted(list, reverse=True), makes it sort backwards.

\begin{lstlisting}
strs = ['aa', 'BB', 'zz', 'CC']
  print sorted(strs)  ## ['BB', 'CC', 'aa', 'zz'] (case sensitive)
  print sorted(strs, reverse=True)   ## ['zz', 'aa', 'CC', 'BB']
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{List Custom Sorting With key=}

\begin{itemize}
\item For more complex custom sorting, sorted() takes an optional "key=" specifying a "key" function that transforms each element before comparison. The key function takes in 1 value and returns 1 value, and the returned "proxy" value is used for the comparisons within the sort.

\item For example with a list of strings, specifying key=len (the built in len() function) sorts the strings by length, from shortest to longest. The sort calls len() for each string to get the list of proxy length values, and then sorts with those proxy values.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
  strs = ['ccc', 'aaaa', 'd', 'bb']
  print sorted(strs, key=len)  ## ['d', 'bb', 'ccc', 'aaaa']
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Lists operators}
  You can concatenate two lists using the \texttt{+} operator:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Lists operators}
  You can mutate a list in place with the \texttt{+=} operator:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Lists operators}
The \texttt{*} operator also works on lists:

[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 ]
  \end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The `{\ttfamily\bfseries in}' operator}

  To test for presence of an item in a collection:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf x in S}:   Evaluates to \texttt{True} if \texttt{x} is equal to a \emph{value}
    contained in the \texttt{S} sequence (list, tuple, set).
\item {\bf x in T}: Evaluates to \texttt{True} if \texttt{x} is a substring of
    string \texttt{T}.

\frametitle{Multiple assignment}
You can assigning multiple variables at the same time
\begin{lstlisting}

1
>>> print(b)
2
\end{lstlisting}

\frametitle{Multiple assignment}
It works with any sequence:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> a, b, c = 'UZH'
>>> print(a)
U
\end{lstlisting}



  Can you think of a way to swap the values of two variables using this?


\begin{lstlisting}
>>> a, b = b, a
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Multiple assignment}
In \texttt{for}:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> L = [(1,'a'), (2,'b'), (3, 'c')]
>>> for x, y in L:
...     print ("first is " + str(x)
...            + ' and second is ' + y)
\end{lstlisting}

  
Useful with functions that return a tuple.

``returning a comma separated elements creates a tuple. Multiple values can only be returned inside containers. It looks a bit peculiar, but it’s actually the comma that forms a tuple, not the parentheses''

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Clarify multiple return values with named tuples}
Is this good or bad? You don't know because it's not clear.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Old testmod return value
doctest.testmod()
# (0, 4)
\end{lstlisting}
Better:
\begin{lstlisting}
# New testmod return value, a namedTuple
doctest.testmod()
# TestResults(failed=0, attempted=4)
\end{lstlisting}

A namedTuple is a subclass of tuple so they still work like a regular tuple, but are more friendly. To make a namedTuple:
\begin{lstlisting}
TestResults = namedTuple('TestResults', ['failed', 'attempted'])
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
p = 'Yogesh', 'Kulkarni', 0x30, 'python@example.com'

# A common approach / habit from other languages
fname = p[0]
lname = p[1]
age = p[2]
email = p[3]
\end{lstlisting}
Better:
\begin{lstlisting}
fname, lname, age, email = p
\end{lstlisting}

This approach uses tuple unpacking and is faster and more readable.

\item Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
\item Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98
\item Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'] ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Exercise}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
%  \item 1: Sort based on name;
%  \item 2: Then sort based on age;
%  \item 3: Then sort by score.
%  \item The priority is that name > age > score.
%  \item If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
%    \begin{lstlisting}
%Tom,19,80
%John,20,90
%Jony,17,91
%Jony,17,93
%Json,21,85
%  \end{lstlisting}
%  \item Then, the output of the program should be: [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
%
%  \item Hints: We use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.
