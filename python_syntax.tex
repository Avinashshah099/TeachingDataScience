\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Statement separator : a semi-colon, 
\item Only needed for multiple statements on a line. 
\item Else, nothing
\item Continuation: a back-slash
\item  But, not necessary in ``context'' : ( ),\{ \},[ ]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Blocks and indentation}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Blocks by indentation
\item No begin/end brackets
\item Indentation is 4 spaces and no hard tabs
\item Reduces clutter
\item \lstinline{if, while, function, except}, etc have $:$ at the end
\item $:$ must follow with an indent on next line.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Everything after ``\#'' ignored.
\begin{lstlisting}
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60

percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage per hour
\end{lstlisting}
\item Useless/redundant:
\begin{lstlisting}
v = 5 # assign 5 to v
\end{lstlisting}
\item Useful info:
\begin{lstlisting}
v = 5 # velocity in meters/second.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Comments}
No block comments
\begin{lstlisting}
# A comment, this is so you can read program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
print("something.") # and the comment after is ignored

# Use a comment to "disable" a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")
\end{lstlisting}

% Doc strings: Comments in quotes at start of module, class, method or function.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% """and here....

% I hate Python
% Nah, just kidding...

% is a multi-line comment"""
% def myfunc():

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Doc strings}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  Carried with executing code. 
% \item Viewed with  \lstinline|help() ,  obj.__doc__ |
% \item IPython: Question mark ( ? ) after, for help.

% \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Exercise}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
% \item      Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw\_input()
% \item      And add document for your own function
    
% \item  Hints:     The built-in document method is \_\_doc\_\_
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Solution}
% \begin{lstlisting}
% print(abs.__doc__)
% print(int.__doc__)
% print)input.__doc__)

% def square(num):
    % '''Return the square value of the input number.
    
    % The input number must be integer.
    % '''
    % return num ** 2

% print(square(2))
% print(square.__doc__)

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Program structure}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  \lstinline|def, class| add something to current name-space. 
% \item Modules: both executable and import-able.
% \item Modules: correspond to files with ``*.py''. 
% \item Packages: correspond to directory, importable
% \item A package contains \lstinline|__init__.py|. 
% \end{itemize}
