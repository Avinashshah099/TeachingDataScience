% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Implementation of neural networks}
% \begin{itemize}

% \item Think of neural networks as being primarily
% defined by a network of individual neurons. 
% \item Helpful both for its simplicity and the historical development of the
% estimators. 
% \item There is a closer way that mimics popular implementations
% such as Caffe, Keras, Torch and TensorFlow.

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Neural network software / libraries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many libraries have been written for training
classes of neural networks. 
\item Most of these try to support operations being compiled to a GPU.
\item Data preprocessing, modeling network, evaluating output, graphical debugging, are some of the facilities given by these libraries.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}

% \item Many of the layers consist of applying
% tensor/matrix products. 
% \item Need highly optimized libraries, often written to take special
% advantage of the particular architecture of a given CPU/GPU.
