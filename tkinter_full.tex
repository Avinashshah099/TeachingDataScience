This code creates a basic GUI with a Label and a Button and places them in a window using the Pack layout manager.

The button has no ``command'' so it has no function when clicked.

%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Graphical User Interfaces with Tkinter}
%%
%%Tk/Tcl has long been an integral part of Python.  It provides a robust
%%and platform independent windowing toolkit, that is available to
%%Python programmers using the \textbf{Tkinter} module, and its
%%extension, the \textbf{Tix} module.
%%
%%The \textbf{Tkinter} module is a thin object--oriented layer on top of
%%Tcl/Tk. To use \textbf{Tkinter}, you don't need to write Tcl code,
%%but you will need to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally
%%the Tcl documentation.  \textbf{Tkinter} is a set of wrappers that
%%implement the Tk widgets as Python classes.  In addition, the internal
%%module \textbf{\_tkinter} provides a threadsafe mechanism which allows
%%Python and Tcl to interact.
%%
%%Tk is not the only GUI for Python, but is however the most commonly
%%used one; see section~\ref{other-gui-modules}, ``Other User Interface
%%Modules and Packages,'' for more information on other GUI toolkits for
%%Python.
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tkinter: Python interface to Tcl/Tk}
%%
%%The Tkinter module (``Tk interface'') is the standard Python
%%interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.  Both Tk and Tkinter are
%%available on most UNIX platforms, as well as on Windows and
%%Macintosh systems.  (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained
%%at ActiveState.)
%%
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tkinter Modules}
%%
%%Most of the time, the \textbf{Tkinter} module is all you really
%%need, but a number of additional modules are available as well.  The
%%Tk interface is located in a binary module named \textbf{\_tkinter}.
%%This module contains the low-level interface to Tk, and should never
%%be used directly by application programmers. It is usually a shared
%%library (or DLL), but might in some cases be statically linked with
%%the Python interpreter.
%%
%%In addition to the Tk interface module, \textbf{Tkinter} includes a
%%number of Python modules. The two most important modules are the
%%\textbf{Tkinter} module itself, and a module called
%%\textbf{Tkconstants}. The former automatically imports the latter, so
%%to use Tkinter, all you need to do is to import one module:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%import Tkinter
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%Or, more often:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%from Tkinter import *
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tkinter Modules}
%%
%%
%%The \textbf{Tk} class is instantiated without arguments.
%%This creates a toplevel widget of Tk which usually is the main window
%%of an appliation. Each instance has its own associated Tcl interpreter.
%%% FIXME: The following keyword arguments are currently recognized:
%%
%%Other modules that provide Tk support include:
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%% \declaremodule{standard}{Tkconstants}
%%% \modulesynopsis{Constants used by Tkinter}
%%% FIXME 
%%
%%\item[\textbf{ScrolledText}]
%%Text widget with a vertical scroll bar built in.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkColorChooser}]
%%Dialog to let the user choose a color.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkCommonDialog}]
%%Base class for the dialogs defined in the other modules listed here.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkFileDialog}]
%%Common dialogs to allow the user to specify a file to open or save.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkFont}]
%%Utilities to help work with fonts.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkMessageBox}]
%%Access to standard Tk dialog boxes.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{tkSimpleDialog}]
%%Basic dialogs and convenience functions.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{Tkdnd}]
%%Drag-and-drop support for \textbf{Tkinter}.
%%This is experimental and should become deprecated when it is replaced 
%%with the Tk DND.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{turtle}]
%%Turtle graphics in a Tk window.

%%
%%% Converted to LaTeX by Mike Clarkson.
%%
%%This section is not designed to be an exhaustive tutorial on either
%%Tk or Tkinter.  Rather, it is intended as a stop gap, providing some
%%introductory orientation on the system.
%%
%%Credits:
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item   Tkinter was written by Steen Lumholt and Guido van Rossum.
%%\item   Tk was written by John Ousterhout while at Berkeley.
%%\item   This Life Preserver was written by Matt Conway at
%%the University of Virginia.
%%\item   The html rendering, and some liberal editing, was
%%produced from a FrameMaker version by Ken Manheimer.
%%\item   Fredrik Lundh elaborated and revised the class interface descriptions,
%%to get them current with Tk 4.2.
%%\item  Mike Clarkson converted the documentation to \LaTeX, and compiled the 
%%User Interface chapter of the reference manual.

%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How To Use This Section}
%%
%%This section is designed in two parts: the first half (roughly) covers
%%background material, while the second half can be taken to the
%%keyboard as a handy reference.
%%
%%When trying to answer questions of the form ``how do I do blah'', it
%%is often best to find out how to do``blah'' in straight Tk, and then
%%convert this back into the corresponding \textbf{Tkinter} call.
%%Python programmers can often guess at the correct Python command by
%%looking at the Tk documentation. This means that in order to use
%%Tkinter, you will have to know a little bit about Tk. This document
%%can't fulfill that role, so the best we can do is point you to the
%%best documentation that exists. Here are some hints:
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item   The authors strongly suggest getting a copy of the Tk man
%%pages. Specifically, the man pages in the \code{mann} directory are most
%%useful. The \code{man3} man pages describe the C interface to the Tk
%%library and thus are not especially helpful for script writers.  
%%
%%\item   Addison-Wesley publishes a book called \textbf{Tcl and the
%%Tk Toolkit} by John Ousterhout (ISBN 0-201-63337-X) which is a good
%%introduction to Tcl and Tk for the novice.  The book is not
%%exhaustive, and for many details it defers to the man pages. 
%%
%%\item   \textbf{Tkinter.py} is a last resort for most, but can be a good
%%place to go when nothing else makes sense.

%%\begin{itemize}

%%explicitly, the system creates one whenever any of the other classes
%%are instantiated.

%%\item    The \textbf{Widget} class is not meant to be instantiated, it
%%is meant only for subclassing to make ``real'' widgets (in Cpp, this
%%is called an `abstract class').

%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{A (Very) Quick Look at Tcl/Tk} % BriefTclTk.html
%%
%%Tk scripts are Tcl programs.  Like all Tcl programs, Tk scripts are
%%just lists of tokens separated by spaces.  A Tk widget is just its
%%\emph{class}, the \emph{options} that help configure it, and the
%%\emph{actions} that make it do useful things. 
%%
%%To make a widget in Tk, the command is always of the form: 
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%                classCommand newPathname options
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item[\textbf{classCommand}]
%%denotes which kind of widget to make (a button, a label, a menu...)
%%
%%\item[\textbf{newPathname}]
%%is the new name for this widget.  All names in Tk must be unique.  To
%%help enforce this, widgets in Tk are named with \emph{pathnames}, just
%%like files in a file system.  The top level widget, the \emph{root},
%%is called \code{.} (period) and children are delimited by more
%%periods.  For example, \code{.myApp.controlPanel.okButton} might be
%%the name of a widget.
%%
%%\item[\textbf{options} ]
%%configure the widget's appearance and in some cases, its
%%behavior.  The options come in the form of a list of flags and values.
%%Flags are proceeded by a `-', like unix shell command flags, and
%%values are put in quotes if they are more than one word.
%%\end{itemize}
%%
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{A (Very) Quick Look at Tcl/Tk} % BriefTclTk.html
%%
%%For example: 
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    button   .fred   -fg red -text ''hi there''
%%       ^       ^     \_____________________/
%%       |       |                |
%%     class    new            options
%%    command  widget  (-opt val -opt val ...)
%%\end{lstlisting} 
%%
%%Once created, the pathname to the widget becomes a new command.  This
%%new \textbf{widget command} is the programmer's handle for getting the new
%%widget to perform some \textbf{action}.  In C, you'd express this as
%%someAction(fred, someOptions), in Cpp, you would express this as
%%fred.someAction(someOptions), and in Tk, you say: 
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    .fred someAction someOptions 
%%\end{lstlisting} 
%%
%%Note that the object name, \code{.fred}, starts with a dot.
%%
%%As you'd expect, the legal values for \textbf{someAction} will depend on
%%the widget's class: \code{.fred disable} works if fred is a
%%button (fred gets greyed out), but does not work if fred is a label
%%(disabling of labels is not supported in Tk). 
%%
%%The legal values of \textbf{someOptions} is action dependent.  Some
%%actions, like \code{disable}, require no arguments, others, like
%%a text-entry box's \code{delete} command, would need arguments
%%to specify what range of text to delete.

%%Class commands in Tk correspond to class constructors in Tkinter.
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    button .fred                =====>  fred = Button()
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%The master of an object is implicit in the new name given to it at

%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    button .panel.fred          =====>  fred = Button(panel)
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%The configuration options in Tk are given in lists of hyphened tags
%%followed by values.  In Tkinter, options are specified as
%%keyword-arguments in the instance constructor, and keyword-args for
%%configure calls or as instance indices, in dictionary style, for
%%established instances.  See section~\ref{tkinter-setting-options} on
%%setting options.
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    button .fred -fg red        =====>  fred = Button(panel, fg = ''red'')

%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{} % BriefTclTk.html
%%In Tk, to perform an action on a widget, use the widget name as a
%%command, and follow it with an action name, possibly with arguments
%%(options).  In Tkinter, you call methods on the class instance to
%%invoke actions on the widget.  The actions (methods) that a given
%%widget can perform are listed in the Tkinter.py module.

%%To give a widget to the packer (geometry manager), you call pack with

%%subclassed from the Packer, and so inherit all the packing
%%methods. See the \textbf{Tix} module documentation for additional

%%
%%\item[\textbf{Tkinter (Python Module)}]
%%This call (say, for example, creating a button widget), is
%%implemented in the \emph{Tkinter} module, which is written in
%%Python.  This Python function will parse the commands and the

%%This C function is able to make calls into other C modules,

%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item[At object creation time, using keyword arguments]:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%fred = Button(self, fg = ''red'', bg = ''blue'')
%%\end{lstlisting}

%%
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Setting Options -tkinter-setting-options}
%%
%%For a complete explanation of a given option and its behavior, see the
%%Tk man pages for the widget in question.
%%
%%Note that the man pages list ''STANDARD OPTIONS'' and ''WIDGET SPECIFIC
%%OPTIONS'' for each widget.  The former is a list of options that are
%%common to many widgets, the latter are the options that are
%%ideosyncratic to that particular widget. 
%%No distinction between standard and widget-specific options is made in
%%this document.  Some options don't apply to some kinds of widgets.
%%Whether a given widget responds to a particular option depends on the
%%class of the widget; buttons have a \code{command} option, labels do not. 
%%
%%The options supported by a given widget are listed in that widget's
%%man page, or can be queried at runtime by calling the
%%\textbf{config()} method without arguments, or by calling the
%%\textbf{keys()} method on that widget.  The return value of these
%%calls is a dictionary whose key is the name of the option as a string
%%(for example, \code{'relief'}) and whose values are 5-tuples.
%%
%%\end{frame}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Setting Options -tkinter-setting-options}
%%Some options, like \code{bg} are synonyms for common options with long
%%names (\code{bg} is shorthand for ''background''). Passing the
%%\code{config()} method the name of a shorthand option will return a
%%2-tuple, not 5-tuple. The 2-tuple passed back will contain the name of
%%the synonym and the ``real'' option (such as \code{('bg',
%%'background')}).
%%
%%%\begin{table}{c|l|l}{textrm}{Index}{Meaning}{Example}
%%%  \lineiii{0}{option name}                       {\code{'relief'}}

%%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Packer} % Packer.html
%%
%%
%%The packer is one of Tk's geometry-management mechanisms.  See also
%%\textbf[classes/ClassPacker.html]{the Packer class interface}.
%%
%%Geometry managers are used to specify the relative positioning of the
%%positioning of widgets within their container - their mutual
%%\emph{master}.  In contrast to the more cumbersome \emph{placer}
%%(which is used less commonly, and we do not cover here), the packer
%%takes qualitative relationship specification - \emph{above}, \emph{to
%%the left of}, \emph{filling}, etc - and works everything out to
%%determine the exact placement coordinates for you. 
%%
%%The size of any \emph{master} widget is determined by the size of
%%the ''slave widgets'' inside.  The packer is used to control where slave
%%widgets appear inside the master into which they are packed.  You can
%%pack widgets into frames, and frames into other frames, in order to
%%achieve the kind of layout you desire.  Additionally, the arrangement
%%is dynamically adjusted to accomodate incremental changes to the
%%configuration, once it is packed.
%%
%%Note that widgets do not appear until they have had their geometry
%%specified with a geometry manager.  It's a common early mistake to
%%leave out the geometry specification, and then be surprised when the
%%widget is created but nothing appears.  A widget will appear only
%%after it has had, for example, the packer's \textbf{pack()} method
%%applied to it.
%%
%%The pack() method can be called with keyword-option/value pairs that
%%control where the widget is to appear within its container, and how it
%%is to behave when the main application window is resized.  Here are
%%some examples:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    fred.pack()                     # defaults to side = ''top''
%%    fred.pack(side = ''left'')
%%    fred.pack(expand = 1)

%%\subsubsection{Coupling Widget Variables} % VarCouplings.html
%%
%%The current-value setting of some widgets (like text entry widgets)
%%can be connected directly to application variables by using special
%%options.  These options are \code{variable}, \code{textvariable},
%%\code{onvalue}, \code{offvalue}, and \code{value}.  This
%%connection works both ways: if the variable changes for any reason,
%%the widget it's connected to will be updated to reflect the new value. 
%%
%%Unfortunately, in the current implementation of \textbf{Tkinter} it is
%%not possible to hand over an arbitrary Python variable to a widget
%%through a \code{variable} or \code{textvariable} option.  The only
%%kinds of variables for which this works are variables that are
%%subclassed from a class called Variable, defined in the
%%\textbf{Tkinter} module.
%%
%%There are many useful subclasses of Variable already defined:
%%\textbf{StringVar}, \textbf{IntVar}, \textbf{DoubleVar}, and
%%\textbf{BooleanVar}.  To read the current value of such a variable,
%%call the \textbf{get()} method on
%%it, and to change its value you call the \textbf{set()} method.  If
%%you follow this protocol, the widget will always track the value of
%%the variable, with no further intervention on your part.
%%
%%For example: 
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%class App(Frame):
%%    def __init__(self, master=None):
%%        Frame.__init__(self, master)
%%        self.pack()
%%        
%%        self.entrythingy = Entry()
%%        self.entrythingy.pack()
%%        
%%        self.button.pack()
%%        # here is the application variable
%%        self.contents = StringVar()
%%        # set it to some value
%%        self.contents.set(''this is a variable'')
%%        # tell the entry widget to watch this variable
%%        self.entrythingy[''textvariable''] = self.contents
%%        
%%        # and here we get a callback when the user hits return.
%%        # we will have the program print out the value of the
%%        # application variable when the user hits return
%%        self.entrythingy.bind('<Key-Return>',
%%                              self.print_contents)
%%
%%    def print_contents(self, event):
%%        print ''hi. contents of entry is now ---->'', \
%%              self.contents.get()
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%
%%\subsubsection{The Window Manager} % WindowMgr.html
%%\index{window manager (widgets)}
%%
%%In Tk, there is a utility command, \code{wm}, for interacting with the
%%window manager.  Options to the \code{wm} command allow you to control
%%things like titles, placement, icon bitmaps, and the like.  In
%%\textbf{Tkinter}, these commands have been implemented as methods
%%on the \textbf{Wm} class.  Toplevel widgets are subclassed from the
%%\textbf{Wm} class, and so can call the \textbf{Wm} methods directly.
%%
%%%See also \textbf[classes/ClassWm.html]{the Wm class interface}.
%%
%%To get at the toplevel window that contains a given widget, you can
%%often just refer to the widget's master.  Of course if the widget has
%%been packed inside of a frame, the master won't represent a toplevel
%%window.  To get at the toplevel window that contains an arbitrary
%%widget, you can call the \textbf{_root()} method.  This
%%method begins with an underscore to denote the fact that this function
%%is part of the implementation, and not an interface to Tk functionality.
%%
%%Here are some examples of typical usage:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%import Tkinter
%%class App(Frame):
%%    def __init__(self, master=None):
%%        Frame.__init__(self, master)
%%        self.pack()
%%
%%
%%# create the application
%%myapp = App()
%%
%%#
%%# here are method calls to the window manager class
%%#
%%myapp.master.title(''My Do-Nothing Application'')
%%myapp.master.maxsize(1000, 400)
%%
%%# start the program
%%myapp.mainloop()
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%
%%\subsubsection{Tk Option Data Types} % OptionTypes.html
%%
%%\index{Tk Option Data Types}
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item[anchor]
%%Legal values are points of the compass: \code{''n''},
%%\code{''ne''}, \code{''e''}, \code{''se''}, \code{''s''},
%%\code{''sw''}, \code{''w''}, \code{''nw''}, and also
%%\code{''center''}.
%%
%%\item[bitmap]
%%There are eight built-in, named bitmaps: \code{'error'}, \code{'gray25'},
%%\code{'gray50'}, \code{'hourglass'}, \code{'info'}, \code{'questhead'},
%%\code{'question'}, \code{'warning'}.  To specify an X bitmap
%%filename, give the full path to the file, preceded with an \code{@},
%%as in \code{''@/usr/contrib/bitmap/gumby.bit''}.
%%
%%\item[boolean]
%%You can pass integers 0 or 1 or the stings \code{''yes''} or \code{''no''} .
%%
%%\item[callback]
%%This is any Python function that takes no arguments.  For example: 
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    def print_it():
%%            print ''hi there''
%%    fred[''command''] = print_it
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%\item[color]
%%Colors can be given as the names of X colors in the rgb.txt file,
%%or as strings representing RGB values in 4 bit: \code{''\#RGB''}, 8
%%bit: \code{''\#RRGGBB''}, 12 bit'' \code{''\#RRRGGGBBB''}, or 16 bit
%%\code{''\#RRRRGGGGBBBB''} ranges, where R,G,B here represent any
%%legal hex digit.  See page 160 of Ousterhout's book for details.  
%%
%%\item[cursor]
%%The standard X cursor names from \textbf{cursorfont.h} can be used,
%%without the \code{XC_} prefix.  For example to get a hand cursor
%%(\constant{XC_hand2}), use the string \code{''hand2''}.  You can also
%%specify a bitmap and mask file of your own.  See page 179 of
%%Ousterhout's book.
%%
%%\item[distance]
%%Screen distances can be specified in either pixels or absolute
%%distances.  Pixels are given as numbers and absolute distances as
%%strings, with the trailing character denoting units: \code{c}
%%for centimeters, \code{i} for inches, \code{m} for millimeters,
%%\code{p} for printer's points.  For example, 3.5 inches is expressed
%%as \code{''3.5i''}.
%%
%%\item[font]
%%Tk uses a list font name format, such as \code{\{courier 10 bold\}}.
%%Font sizes with positive numbers are measured in points;
%%sizes with negative numbers are measured in pixels.
%%
%%\item[geometry]
%%This is a string of the form \samp{\textbf{width}x\textbf{height}}, where
%%width and height are measured in pixels for most widgets (in
%%characters for widgets displaying text).  For example:
%%\code{fred[''geometry''] = ''200x100''}.
%%
%%\item[justify]
%%Legal values are the strings: \code{''left''},
%%\code{''center''}, \code{''right''}, and \code{''fill''}.
%%
%%\item[region]
%%This is a string with four space-delimited elements, each of
%%which is a legal distance (see above).  For example: \code{''2 3 4
%%5''} and \code{''3i 2i 4.5i 2i''} and \code{''3c 2c 4c 10.43c''} 
%%are all legal regions.
%%
%%\item[relief]
%%Determines what the border style of a widget will be.  Legal
%%values are: \code{''raised''}, \code{''sunken''},
%%\code{''flat''}, \code{''groove''}, and \code{''ridge''}.
%%
%%\item[scrollcommand]
%%This is almost always the \textbf{set()} method of some scrollbar
%%widget, but can be any widget method that takes a single argument.  
%%Refer to the file \textbf{Demo/tkinter/matt/canvas-with-scrollbars.py}
%%in the Python source distribution for an example.
%%
%%\item[wrap:]
%%Must be one of: \code{''none''}, \code{''char''}, or \code{''word''}.
%%\end{itemize}
%%
%%
%%\subsubsection{Bindings and Events} % Bindings.html
%%
%%\index{bind (widgets)}
%%\index{events (widgets)}
%%
%%The bind method from the widget command allows you to watch for
%%certain events and to have a callback function trigger when that event
%%type occurs.  The form of the bind method is:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    def bind(self, sequence, func, add=''):
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%where:
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item[sequence]
%%is a string that denotes the target kind of event.  (See the bind
%%man page and page 201 of John Ousterhout's book for details).
%%
%%\item[func]
%%is a Python function, taking one argument, to be invoked when the
%%event occurs.  An Event instance will be passed as the argument.
%%(Functions deployed this way are commonly known as \textbf{callbacks}.)
%%
%%\item[add]
%%is optional, either \samp{} or \samp{+}.  Passing an empty string
%%denotes that this binding is to replace any other bindings that this
%%event is associated with.  Preceeding with a \samp{+} means that this
%%function is to be added to the list of functions bound to this event type.
%%\end{itemize}
%%
%%For example:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%    def turnRed(self, event):
%%        event.widget[''activeforeground''] = ''red''
%%
%%    self.button.bind(''<Enter>'', self.turnRed)
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%Notice how the widget field of the event is being accesed in the
%%\textbf{turnRed()} callback.  This field contains the widget that
%%caught the X event.  The following table lists the other event fields
%%you can access, and how they are denoted in Tk, which can be useful
%%when referring to the Tk man pages.
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}

%%\subsubsection{The index Parameter} % Index.html
%%
%%A number of widgets require``index'' parameters to be passed.  These

%%particular characters in an Entry widget, or to particular menu items
%%in a Menu widget.
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item[\textbf{Entry widget indexes (index, view index, etc.)}]
%%Entry widgets have options that refer to character positions in the

%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item   an integer which refers to the numeric position of the entry in
%%the widget, counted from the top, starting with 0; 
%%\item   the string \code{'active'}, which refers to the menu position that is
%%currently under the cursor;
%%\item   the string \code{''last''} which refers to the last menu
%%item;  
%%\item   An integer preceded by \code{@}, as in \code{@6}, where the integer is
%%interpreted as a y pixel coordinate in the menu's coordinate system;
%%\item   the string \code{''none''}, which indicates no menu entry at all, most
%%often used with menu.activate() to deactivate all entries, and
%%finally,
%%\item   a text string that is pattern matched against the label of the
%%menu entry, as scanned from the top of the menu to the bottom.  Note
%%that this index type is considered after all the others, which means
%%that matches for menu items labelled \code{last}, \code{active}, or

%%The \textbf{Tix} (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an
%%additional rich set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has
%%many useful widgets, they are far from complete. The \textbf{Tix}
%%library provides most of the commonly needed widgets that are missing
%%from standard Tk: \textbf{HList}, \textbf{ComboBox}, \textbf{Control}
%%(a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment of scrollable widgets. \textbf{Tix}
%%also includes many more widgets that are generally useful in a wide
%%range of applications: \textbf{NoteBook}, \textbf{FileEntry},
%%\textbf{PanedWindow}, etc; there are more than 40 of them.
%%
%%With all these new widgets, you can introduce new interaction
%%techniques into applications, creating more useful and more intuitive
%%user interfaces. You can design your application by choosing the most
%%appropriate widgets to match the special needs of your application and
%%users.

%%\subsection{Using Tix}
%%
%%\begin{classdesc}{Tix}{screenName\optional{, baseName\optional{, className}}}
%%    Toplevel widget of Tix which represents mostly the main window
%%    of an application. It has an associated Tcl interpreter.
%%
%%Classes in the \textbf{Tix} module subclasses the classes in the
%%\textbf{Tkinter} module. The former imports the latter, so to use
%%\textbf{Tix} with Tkinter, all you need to do is to import one
%%module. In general, you can just import \textbf{Tix}, and replace
%%the toplevel call to \textbf{Tkinter.Tk} with \textbf{Tix.Tk}:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%import Tix
%%from Tkconstants import *
%%root = Tix.Tk()
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%\end{classdesc}
%%
%%To use \textbf{Tix}, you must have the \textbf{Tix} widgets installed,
%%usually alongside your installation of the Tk widgets.
%%To test your installation, try the following:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%import Tix
%%root = Tix.Tk()
%%root.tk.eval('package require Tix')
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%If this fails, you have a Tk installation problem which must be
%%resolved before proceeding. Use the environment variable \envvar{TIX_LIBRARY}
%%to point to the installed \textbf{Tix} library directory, and
%%make sure you have the dynamic object library (\textbf{tix8183.dll} or
%%\textbf{libtix8183.so}) in  the same directory that contains your Tk
%%dynamic object library (\textbf{tk8183.dll} or \textbf{libtk8183.so}). The
%%directory with the dynamic object library should also have a file
%%called \textbf{pkgIndex.tcl} (case sensitive), which contains the line:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%package ifneeded Tix 8.1 [list load ''[file join $dir tix8183.dll]'' Tix]
%%\end{lstlisting} % $ <-- bow to font-lock

%%
%%\begin{classdesc}{tixCommand}{}
%%The \ulink{tix commands}
%%{http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tix.htm}
%%provide access to miscellaneous elements of \textbf{Tix}'s internal
%%state and the  \textbf{Tix} application context.  Most of the information
%%manipulated by these methods pertains to the application as a whole,
%%or to a screen or display, rather than to a particular window.
%%
%%To view the current settings, the common usage is:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%import Tix
%%root = Tix.Tk()
%%print root.tix_configure()
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%\end{classdesc}
%%
%%\begin{methoddesc}{tix_configure}{\optional{cnf,} **kw}
%%Query or modify the configuration options of the Tix application
%%context. If no option is specified, returns a dictionary all of the
%%available options.  If option is specified with no value, then the
%%method returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
%%be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
%%option is specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are
%%specified, then the method modifies the given option(s) to have the
%%given value(s); in this case the method returns an empty string.
%%Option may be any of the configuration options.
%%\end{methoddesc}
%%
%%\begin{methoddesc}{tix_cget}{option}
%%Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
%%\textbf{option}. Option may be any of the configuration options.
%%\end{methoddesc}
%%
%%\begin{methoddesc}{tix_getbitmap}{name}
%%Locates a bitmap file of the name \code{name.xpm} or \code{name} in
%%one of the bitmap directories (see the \textbf{tix_addbitmapdir()}
%%method).  By using \textbf{tix_getbitmap()}, you can avoid hard
%%coding the pathnames of the bitmap files in your application. When
%%successful, it returns the complete pathname of the bitmap file,
%%prefixed with the character \samp{@}.  The returned value can be used to
%%configure the \code{bitmap} option of the Tk and Tix widgets.
%%\end{methoddesc}
%%
%%\begin{methoddesc}{tix_addbitmapdir}{directory}
%%Tix maintains a list of directories under which the
%%\textbf{tix_getimage()} and \textbf{tix_getbitmap()} methods will
%%search for image files.  The standard bitmap directory is
%%\textbf{\$TIX_LIBRARY/bitmaps}. The \textbf{tix_addbitmapdir()} method
%%adds \textbf{directory} into this list. By using this method, the image
%%files of an applications can also be located using the
%%\textbf{tix_getimage()} or \textbf{tix_getbitmap()} method.
%%\end{methoddesc}
%%
%%\begin{methoddesc}{tix_filedialog}{\optional{dlgclass}}
%%Returns the file selection dialog that may be shared among different

%%\sectionauthor{Fred L. Drake, Jr.}{fdrake@acm.org}
%%
%%The \textbf{ScrolledText} module provides a class of the same name
%%which implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar
%%configured to do the ``right thing.''  Using the \textbf{ScrolledText}
%%class is a lot easier than setting up a text widget and scroll bar
%%directly.  The constructor is the same as that of the
%%\textbf{Tkinter.Text} class.
%%
%%The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a \textbf{Frame},
%%and the methods of the \textbf{Grid} and \textbf{Pack} geometry managers
%%are acquired from the \textbf{Frame} object.  This allows the
%%\textbf{ScrolledText} widget to be used directly to achieve most normal
%%geometry management behavior.
%%
%%Should more specific control be necessary, the following attributes
%%are available:
%%
%%\begin{memberdesc}[ScrolledText]{frame}
%%  The frame which surrounds the text and scroll bar widgets.
%%\end{memberdesc}

%%\subsubsection{Command line usage}
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%idle.py [-c command] [-d] [-e] [-s] [-t title] [arg] ...
%%
%%-c command  run this command
%%-d          enable debugger
%%-e          edit mode; arguments are files to be edited
%%-s          run $IDLESTARTUP or $PYTHONSTARTUP first
%%-t title    set title of shell window
%%\end{lstlisting}
%%
%%If there are arguments:
%%
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item   If \programopt{-e} is used, arguments are files opened for
%%        editing and \code{sys.argv} reflects the arguments passed to
%%        IDLE itself.
%%
%%\item   Otherwise, if \programopt{-c} is used, all arguments are
%%        placed in \code{sys.argv[1:...]}, with \code{sys.argv[0]} set
%%        to \code{'-c'}.
%%
%%\item   Otherwise, if neither \programopt{-e} nor \programopt{-c} is
%%        used, the first argument is a script which is executed with
%%        the remaining arguments in \code{sys.argv[1:...]}  and
%%        \code{sys.argv[0]} set to the script name.  If the script name
%%        is '-', no script is executed but an interactive Python
%%        session is started; the arguments are still available in
%%        \code{sys.argv}.
