## Requirements:
* LaTeX (tested with MikTex 2.9 on Windows 7, 64bit)
* Need to install LaTeX packages, as and when you get such warning/suggestions.

## How to Run:
* Driver files for the courses are named with "Main_Workshop/Seminar_<course>_CheatSheet/Presentation.tex"
* Both the Cheatsheet (meaning course notes in two column format) and Presentation.tex refer to same core content file, which in turn contains are the topic files.
* Run make bat for the course you need. Inside, its just a texify command, so you can modify it as per your OS.
* You can compile individual "Main_Workshop/Seminar_<course>_CheatSheet/Presentation.tex" also using your LaTeX system.
* Instead of these given driver files, you can have your own main files and include just the *content.tex files.
