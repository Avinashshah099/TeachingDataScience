%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Implementing NLP}
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item World is awash with language data
%    \item Inadequate tools (will this ever change?)
%    \item Overheads: Perl, Prolog, Java
%    \item Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) as a solution
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Practical NLP}
A wide variety of open-source tools for NLP
  \begin{itemize}
%    \item In most programming languages
%    \item We present only a few, most popular 
%    \item They contain set of tools which form a NLP pipeline (at least morphology \& 
%syntax, some semantics and pragmatics)
    \item Stanford CoreNLP
    \item Python NLTK
    \item Cython spaCy - newer
    \item Gensim
%    \item There are several other specific tools (e.g. for Word2Vec, LSA, WordNet, 
%etc.) and NLP packages (OpenNLP, Lingpipe)
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Stanford CoreNLP}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Implemented in Java
    \item Widely used in research and commercial products
    \item Pipeline: sentence splitter, tokenizer, lemmatizer, POS tagger, 
(syntactic and dependency) parser, corefernce resolution, named-
entity recognition, etc.
    \item Available for several languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, French, 
German)
    \item Link: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
    \item Demo: http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{NLTK}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Natural Language ToolKit
    \item Available in Python
    \item Lots of implemented modules (full list here: http://www.nltk.org/py-
modindex.html) 
    \item Provides the same functionality as CoreNLP and even more (can use 
CoreNLP if needed)
    \item Also implements several classifier and some simple conversational 
agents
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{SpaCy}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item   Newer, faster (at least this in their benchmarks) than previous 
solutions
    \item Implemented in Cython
    \item ``High performance tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, named entity 
recognizer and syntactic dependency parser, with built-in support for 
word vectors''
    \item Link: https://spacy.io/
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Other}
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Python - Simple yet powerfulThe zen of python : http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
%    \item Very clear, readable syntax
%    \item Strong introspection capabilities
%http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyint.html (recommended) 
%    \item Intuitive object orientation
%    \item Natural expression of procedural code
%    \item Full modularity, supporting hierarchical packages
%    \item Exception-based error handling
%    \item Very high level dynamic data types
%    \item Extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually every task
%    \item Excellent functionality for processing linguistic data.
%    \item NLTK is one such extensive third party module.
%          \end{itemize}

%    \item gensim
%    \item MITIE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Other}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item   Gensim (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/): for computing word embeddings, including Word2Vec
    \item SyntaxNet (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html) : syntactic parser from Google, released in 2016 , very accurate
    \item Lots more -:)
          \end{itemize}
We are going ahead with Python + Nltk/Gensim
